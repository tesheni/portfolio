                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, my name is Tesheni Perera, and this is my 12th-grade portfolio.
                    Some of my hobbies are drawing, listening to music, and writing. My main passions are writing & designing,
                    which I 
                    picked up recently. My experience in Edison had its ups and downs, however, as of right now I'm happy with the experiences 
                    I went through because all of them taught me a valuable lesson. I'm not the best coder, 
                    but I never would've thought that I would be in a class that involves coding considering 
                    I was first introduced to coding in sixth grade. Also, in my day-to-day life, I usually take breaks where I blast music and dance for some time to relieve stress. Overall, as a person, I'm still navigating the world around me and since I don't have all the answers in the world I'll always have a curious heart throughout my journey in life.
                </p>

            <h3>SHOP : WEB APP DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>When entering this shop class in sophomore year it was an interesting experience. We learned about the 
                fundamentals of CSS, and HTML, and created our websites. We discovered different ways to make buttons, links, cards, and lists.  
                At first, I never thought I would be in a class where I would code, it wasn't my plan at first, but the 
                more that we got into the designing aspect I enjoyed it. Moving forward in 11th grade we learned the fundamentals of 
                Python, 
                such as lists, return commands, functions, and using our prior knowledge to finish assignments in Project Stem. With our coding skills we not only how to be critical, but implement coding in ways we can help with important issues. For example, we were allowed to build an app that can help users struggling with their emotional needs.    </p>
